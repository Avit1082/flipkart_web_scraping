# flipkart_web_scraping
In this I have used BeautifulSoup library of python for Web Scraping. In this I have searched for iphone on the flipkart's site and retrive the information of available iphones such as name,price and ratings
### app.py 
To run app.py you must have following librarys:
requests   -> to query 
bs4        -> it contains BeautifulSoup it is used for web scraping
pandas     -> used for data handling and csv conversion
